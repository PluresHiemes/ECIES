This bitcoind address validator is a subclass of the Django forms.CharField class, but could easily be adapted to other frameworks or to be standalone code.

It does a "deep" validation, checking that the checksum built into every bitcoin address matches the address. It needs the PyCrypto library for the SHA256 function.

I hereby release this code into the public domain, do with it what you will.  And please let me know if you find any bugs in it.
